## Insights into Kick-Starting a Social Venture

### Finding the Idea

"Find a problem that you are passionate about. It is not an easy journey! If you do not feel incredibly passionate about what you are doing, and if it does not give you the motivation to keep going, it is going to be tough.", Kayli underlines.

The idea is to make sure to "choose a problem that **needs** solving," and you are willing to put the effort in to solve it.

### First Steps

Kayli believes it is crucial always to be adaptable and **resilient**. A Friendlier Company faced two significant obstacles at the beginning:
- Being constantly **rejected**; and
- Targeting large event venues and having to deal with COVID-19 (e.g. large unsold inventory).

However, they **adjusted quickly** to the changes taking place in the market and "built a system that would work during the pandemic" and would tackle the ongoing increase in takeout waste. They also adopted an iterative and focused approach that helped them move forward.

Moreover, Kayli highlights that "every piece of [their] process was a big undertaking," and they leveraged their previous exposure to the startup world and experiences to design this process. According to her, other essential factors to the company's success include:
- Applying to many programs;
- **Networking** with as many people as possible; and
- Being willing to change your mind about your ideas.

### Scaling-up

Raising equity enables growth and scaling-up quickly to make a significant impact. A Friendlier Company won funding through programs first, then small equity fundraising and now they are contemplating opening up their pre-seed.

They also work with a few groups from various universities (from engineering to marketing) and are hiring co-ops students to give back to the programs that initially helped them. Also, they look for people who "**understand the problem they are trying to address and feel passionate about solving it**" through conferences and networking events, for instance.

## Inspiration to Go!

> There are so many important problems out there that are not getting enough attention, especially in the social impact area.
> Those areas can still be profitable, and they need businesses and smart people to come in, work on those problems and build up those markets. It is an extremely fun and exciting journey, and I do not think you will regret it!
