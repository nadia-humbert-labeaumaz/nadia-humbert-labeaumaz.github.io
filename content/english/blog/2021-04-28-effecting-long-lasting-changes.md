Change is hard.

However, sometimes, we cannot avoid it. This state of fact applies to our personal lives, as well as at the organizational level. For instance, companies that did not even consider remote working as an option less than two years ago must let us work from home now.

Changes will happen whether we want them or not. But what can make these changes successful in the long run?

<!--more-->

First, we need to understand that we have two different processes at stake: the **change process** itself and the **transition**.

In the example above, the change process can include getting a laptop, having flexible hours to take care of the children and having proper tools to communicate.

On the other hand, the transition is more about getting to accept and leverage this new situation. Here, it implies letting the old habits go and finding ways to adapt to the new context, such as going for a walk in the morning, eating at fixed times or anything that might suit you.

While the change might be imposed on you, the transition is a personal journey â€“ we all go through it differently! These two separate processes have different lifecycles and potentially different actors. However, they affect each other. Indeed, **a well-managed change can facilitate the transition, and a smooth transition makes the change successful in the long run**. For instance, having access to the right resources and having clear and simple guidelines regarding flexible work can significantly impact people's transition. On the flip side, people's well-being in the new context is crucial for sustainable change.  

As a change agent, it is essential to enable people's transition. Organizations often overlook this. However, not doing so sets your organization up for failure. To effect long-lasting changes, you should make sure that everyone finishes their transition.

## The Takeaway
Lasting changes are the product of the change process, usually the same for all the organization members, and the transition, unique to each individual. The completion of both these interrelated processes is required to succeed in the long run.
