- • Helped define a roadmap to ensure product-market fit.
- • Ensured strategic alignment across departments.
- • Set up a software development process which paved the way for the company to replace its legacy platform with this new one. This process successfully underwent an audit from EY.
- • Reduced time-to-market to gain traction among the new customer base.
