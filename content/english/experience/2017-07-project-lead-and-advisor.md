## Description

Led the development of a French startup’s international platform (15 people team). It was critical for the company’s business strategy as it allowed opening new markets in Europe.

**Achievements**
- • Doubled the team's long-term velocity, without compromising quality, by providing support for the entire team, fostering knowledge sharing, addressing functional and technical bottlenecks as well as introducing a more Agile and engaged mindset.

- • Helped define a roadmap to ensure product-market fit.
- • Set up a software development process which paved the way for the company to replace its legacy platform with this new one. This process successfully underwent an audit from EY.
- • Reduced time-to-market to gain traction among the new customer base.
