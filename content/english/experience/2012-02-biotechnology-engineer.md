## Description

Optimised the measurement parameters of highly strategic equipment for Sanofi Pasteur in a couple of months. It was attempted many times before, for several years, with no success.

This project took place in a high-stakes context for Sanofi Pasteur.

**Achievements**
- • Designed, planned and implemented the optimisation strategy using an experimental design (Taguchi).

- • Defined and planned the qualification strategy in collaboration with several departments.
- • Successfully led the equipment's qualification. As a result, in afew months, the equipment replaced the obsolete one that was jeopardising the entire production chain.
- • Trained the technicians to use the new equipment.
