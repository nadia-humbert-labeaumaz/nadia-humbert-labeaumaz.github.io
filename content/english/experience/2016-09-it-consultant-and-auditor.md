## Description

Provided consulting services to help companies of all sizes and industries grow and address strategic, organisational and technical challenges.

It always started by participating in the company's day-to-day activities and interacting with all its stakeholders. The idea was to adopt a systemic approach, analysing the organisation’s state through different perspectives, to gain a deeper understanding of the company's needs.

**Achievements**
- • Helped 10+ companies seize new business opportunities, increase and enhance interactions and knowledge sharing, manage constraints, as well as simplify and optimise processes.

- • Broke silos between departments and enabled company-wide initiatives by interacting with all the stakeholders (leadership, engineering, product and sales teams).
- • Provided technical coaching to 15+ teams from 5 to 40 people. The teams could then develop new features readily and tackle technical debt while significantly reducing their defect rate.
- • Audited 5+ software systems and provided concrete and actionable recommendations tailored to improve the code, architecture and development process.
