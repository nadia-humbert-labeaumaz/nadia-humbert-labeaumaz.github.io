## Description

Developed an online free platform to manage invoices and help Honduran entrepreneurs through the related significant changes in their legislation.

**Achievements**
- • Designed a simple and user-friendly platform to abstract all the Honduran legislation's complexity (invoice numeration, format, required information, and marginal cases).

- • Prevented the government from closing small businesses that did not have the resources or the knowledge to meet the new requirements.
