## Description

Led the QA team of a BioMérieux project aiming to enable the validation and release of medical reagents batches at the end of the production chain (10 people team).

**Achievements**
- • Ensured that the differences between the new software's calculations and the old software's ones were not statistically significant.

- • Designed a relevant testing strategy to validate the entire application at minimal cost and risk. After our validation, the system was successfully deployed in production.
