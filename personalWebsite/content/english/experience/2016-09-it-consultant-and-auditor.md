## Description

Consulting services to help companies of all sizes and industries grow and address organisational and technical challenges.

It always started by participating in the company's day-to-day activities and interacting with all its stakeholders. The idea was to adopt a systemic approach to analyse the organisation's state through different perspectives and understand its needs.

**Achievements**
- • Helped 10+ companies address organisational challenges by increasing and enhancing interactions and knowledge sharing, managing constraints, as well as simplifying and optimising processes.

- • Provided technical coaching to 15+ teams from 5 to 40 people. The teams could then develop new features readily and tackle technical debt while significantly reducing their defect rate.
- • Audited 5+ software systems and provided concrete and actionable recommendations tailored to improve the code, architecture and development process.
