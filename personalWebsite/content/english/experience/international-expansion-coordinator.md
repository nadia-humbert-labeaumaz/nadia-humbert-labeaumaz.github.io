## Description

Helped a French start-up extend its IT team abroad by setting up a mechanism to outsource some developments to an Offshore Development Center (ODC). The objective was to keep high-quality standards and develop a meaningful collaboration between the two parties.

**Achievements**
- • Defined a shared vision, aligned with the company's objectives, that resonated with both teams.

- • Successfully ensured the continuous delivery of value in this context of distributed teams through support, coordination, constraint management and risk mitigation.
- • Designed fit-for-purpose indicators to collect feedback from the teams and monitor performance, quality, and profitability: their strong performance and invariability confirmed the mechanism's efficiency.
- • Increased the overall IT department's production capacity by 30%, while increasing the costs by 10% only.
