## Description

Successfully optimised the measurement parameters of highly strategic equipment for Sanofi Pasteur, in a laboratory of marketed products' immunochemical controls. It was attempted many times before, for several years, with no success.

his project took place in a high-stakes context for Sanofi Pasteur.

**Achievements**
- • Defined and planned the optimisation strategy using an experimental design (Taguchi). Performed measurements, analysed the results and set up optimised parameters.

- • Defined and planned the qualification strategy in collaboration with several departments.
- • Successfully led the equipment's qualification. As a result, the equipment has been used in production to replace the obsolete one that was jeopardising the entire production chain.
- • Trained the technicians to use the new equipment.
