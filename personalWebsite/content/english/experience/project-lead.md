## Description

Project Lead of a French start-up's international platform (15 people team). The goal was to develop a new product that was critical for the company's business strategy as it allowed opening new markets in Europe.

**Achievements**
- • Managed the release of the platform's first version in only a few months to reduce time-to-market and gain traction among the new customer base.

- • Doubled the team's long-term velocity, without compromising quality, by providing support for the entire team, fostering knowledge sharing, addressing functional and technical bottlenecks as well as introducing a more Agile and engaged mindset.
- • Set up a software development process which paved the way for the company to replace its legacy platform with this new one. This process successfully underwent an audit from EY.
