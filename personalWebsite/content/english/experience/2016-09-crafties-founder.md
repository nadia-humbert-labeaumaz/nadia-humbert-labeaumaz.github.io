## Description

After a few years in the IT industry, I started noticing some recurring needs that were not properly covered in the market. So, I decided to become self-employed and explore my hypothesis. After a year of exploration, I confirmed the potential of my offer and decided to create an entity to continue developing my business - making 150k€ a year in revenues.

During my time running Crafties, I had the chance to develop several entrepreneurial skills such as:

- • Defining a marketing and business strategy

- • Developing a client portfolio
- • Managing and negotiating contracts
- • Working closely with company executives
- • Establishing partnerships with other players in the market
- • Gaining some insights into the accounting and legal aspects of the business
